The morning light, filtered through the curtains, felt heavy on Ranma’s eyelids. She blinked, a wave of disorientation washing over her. Her body ached, a pleasant, exhausted throb that spoke of a night unlike any she’d experienced. She shifted, intending to sit up, but found herself pinned, her back pressed against a warm, solid form.

Junichi.

She was spooned from behind, his arm a heavy weight across her waist, his chest warm against her back. A flush crept up her neck as fragmented memories of the previous night flooded back – the escalating intimacy, the loss of control, the sheer, overwhelming sensation. And then, a cold dread seized her.

Something was…wrong.

A pressure, a fullness, deep within her. A horrifying realization dawned. Junichi’s flaccid member was *inside* her.

Ranma’s breath hitched. Mortification burned through her, hotter than any hot spring. This wasn’t training. This wasn’t a lesson. This was… a violation. A sickening wave of nausea rose in her throat. How could she have let this happen? She, Ranma Saotome, the undefeated martial artist, reduced to this… this helpless state.
