By night, the atmosphere shifted. Lanterns cast golden halos across the tiled floors, illuminating the room in a soft, intimate glow. The air was thick with humidity, heavy with the scent of perfume and the lingering traces of chlorine from the pool. It was in these moments, when the world outside faded into silence, that Lilly and Rose allowed themselves to give in—to the pull of their desires, to the promise of something deeper than friendship.

Kai jumped on the bed, his tail wagging in anticipation. He had already registered the girls’ growing arousal throughout the day and was ready to serve.

Rose lay back on the mattress, her hands trailing over her own skin, tracing the line of her collarbone, the curve of her waist. Her lips parted in a slow exhale, her gaze flicking to Lilly. “You’re staring,” she teased, tilting her chin upward.

“I can’t help it,” Lilly replied, her voice hoarse. “You look so beautiful with Kai here.”

Rose smirked, rolling onto her side to press against Lilly, her thigh brushing against Lilly’s hip. “Come here,” she whispered, her fingers grazing the edge of Lilly’s bikini bottom. “Let’s see what Kai thinks of you.”

Kai approached, his nose twitching as he sniffed the air, catching the scent of their arousal. His eyes gleamed with recognition, his AI processing the signals embedded in their pheromones. Without hesitation, he lowered his muzzle to Lilly’s neck, his tongue sweeping across the sensitive skin. She gasped, arching into the touch, her fingers digging into the sheets as a shiver ran through her.

Rose moaned softly, watching as Kai continued his exploration, his tongue moving lower, tracing the hollow of Lilly’s collarbone before dipping into the valley between her breasts. Lilly trembled, her breath coming in uneven gulps as she reached for Rose, her fingers tangling in her friend’s hair.

“You like that, don’t you?” Rose murmured, leaning forward to kiss Lilly’s jawline.

Lilly whimpered, nodding against Rose’s shoulder. “Yes… so much…”

Kai switched sides, his attention shifting to Rose. His tongue slid over her exposed skin, circling her nipple before drawing it into his mouth. Rose arched her back, her fingers gripping the sheets as she let out a sharp gasp. “Oh god, yes…”

Lilly watched, her heart pounding as she realized how much Rose wanted this. How much she craved the sensation of being pleasured by someone else. Someone like Kai.

Without thinking, she reached for the app on her phone, her fingers shaking slightly as she accessed the control panel. Her eyes scanned the options, landing on the setting that would allow Kai to respond more intensely. She hesitated for only a second before tapping the confirmation button.

Kai’s response was immediate. His tongue became faster, more precise, his movements calculated yet instinctive. He adjusted his position, lowering himself further until his nose hovered inches from Rose’s core. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he dipped his tongue inside her.

Rose let out a strangled cry, her entire body convulsing as pleasure surged through her. Lilly watched, transfixed, as her friend writhed beneath Kai’s ministrations, her legs tightening around his head as she neared orgasm.

Unable to resist any longer, Lilly climbed onto the bed beside Rose, positioning herself so that Kai could reach her as well. She spread her legs, offering herself to him, her breath hitching as his tongue traced the folds of her pussy before slipping inside.

“Oh my god…” she breathed, her fingers clutching at Rose’s arm.

Rose wrapped an arm around her waist, holding her close as they both surrendered to the sensations coursing through them. Kai worked tirelessly, alternating between them, his tongue finding every erogenous zone, his teeth nipping gently at their inner thighs.

Lilly felt her climax building, her body trembling as she reached for Rose, their fingers intertwining as they rode the wave of pleasure together.

With a final thrust of his tongue, Kai pushed them both over the edge. Their screams merged into one, echoing through the room as they shattered apart, their bodies slick with sweat and need.

As the last echoes of their release faded, Lilly collapsed onto the bed, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Rose rolled onto her side, panting heavily, her eyes half-lidded with satisfaction.

Kai approached Rose first, stepping over her, his nose brushing against her cheek before his tongue dragged across her lips. Rose opened her mouth, allowing him entry, her tongue meeting his in a slow, languid kiss.

At the same time, Lilly noticed Kai’s erection hanging loose between his legs, pointing at Rose’s wet and flushed pussy. Continuing to dominate Rose’s mouth with his tongue, Kai began to drag his dick over her soaked slit, smearing her juices along his shaft while continuing to kiss her passionately.

Lilly watched, her breath hitching as she took in the sight of her best friend being devoured by Kai. The way Rose moaned into his mouth, the way her fingers tightened in his fur, the way her body quivered with each passing second.

She wanted to be城镇 part of this too. To feel Kai’s tongue on her again, to taste him, to lose herself completely in the sensation.

But right now, she simply watched. Let the moment consume her. Let the fire burn.

Kai continued to grind his cock against Rose’s lower labia, his pre-cum mixing with her fluids. His ultimate intention was clear.

“Rose, Kai wants to fuck you,” Lilly stated, her voice low and husky.

Rose didn’t answer, her eyes closed, her lips still attached to Kai’s. Instead, she lifted her hips, spreading her legs wider, inviting him in.

Kai positioned himself carefully, aligning his cock with Rose’s entrance. With a slow, deliberate push, he entered her, his synthetic member sliding deep into her warmth.

Rose let out a muffled cry, her fingers clawing at the sheets as she adjusted to the intrusion. Her body tensed briefly before relaxing, her muscles wrapping around Kai’s shaft as he began to move.

Lilly bit her lip, watching as Kai fucked Rose slowly, his strokes measured and controlled. The way his hips rocked against hers, the way his cock disappeared into her depths with each thrust.

It was beautiful. Intoxicating.

And suddenly, she needed more. Needed to feel it too.

She turned to Rose, pressing her lips to her ear. “Tell me what it feels like,” she whispered.

Rose groaned, her breath hot against Lilly’s neck. “Feels amazing… so full… like I’m melting…”

Lilly watched as Kai plundered Rose’s mouth with his tongue while fucking her deeply, his cock disappearing into her again and again. She could see the way Rose’s body reacted, the way her thighs trembled, the way her breath came in ragged gasps.

And then, without warning, Kai released.

A strangled growl escaped his throat as he spilled his seed into Rose, his cock pulsing violently as he emptied himself into her.

Rose let out a choked sob, her body bucking against Kai as she climaxed, wrapping her arms around his neck, her nails digging into his fur.

Lilly stared, mesmerized, as Kai collapsed onto Rose, his cock still buried deep within her.

“He’s still coming inside me,” Rose panted, her voice raw with pleasure. “So much…”

Lilly watched in awed disbelief as Rose’s pussy filled with Kai’s cum, her walls squeezing tightly around his cock as she milked him dry.

And then, as if sensing her presence, Kai turned his head, his glowing blue eyes locking onto Lilly’s.

He licked his lips.

Then, without a word, he pulled out of Rose and turned to her.
